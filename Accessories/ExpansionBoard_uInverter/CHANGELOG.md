
## REVB

- Provide parallel decoupling capacitance as suggested in [Gate Driver](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/ixys-integrated-circuits-division/IXDN614CI/2424705) datasheet
- Add two small (10 uF) ceramic capacitors for DC link ([#199](https://github.com/Severson-Group/AMDC-Hardware/issues/199))
- Reverse current sensing differential amplifier input polarity ([#193](https://github.com/Severson-Group/AMDC-Hardware/issues/193))
- Add low pass filter capacitor at DC bus voltage sensing point ([#192](https://github.com/Severson-Group/AMDC-Hardware/issues/192))
- Remove screw connectors and provide cutout in PCB for current sensing ([#197](https://github.com/Severson-Group/AMDC-Hardware/issues/197))
- Replace SMD components with 0603 size by 0805 sized components
- Fix BOM with correct part number for DC bus voltage potential devider resistors ([#194](https://github.com/Severson-Group/AMDC-Hardware/issues/194))
- Modify component placement and PCB layout
