## Design Requirements and Considerations

The isolated serial peripheral interface (isoSPI) has increased noise immunity and safety. The design requirements for the isoSPI and differential I/O (D_IO) interface are as follows:

1. Implement four isoSPI and four differential I/O interfaces.

2. Implement a voltage level translator to interface with the FPGA that operates at 1.8V.

### 1. DB15 Connector

A total of two DB15 D-sub high-density connectors are used for both the isoSPI and differential I/O (D_I / D_O) interface. Each connector has pins for 2 isoSPI communication interfaces, 2 differential I/O interfaces, 1 pin for ground signals, and 1 pin for 5V supply from the AMDC.


The pin mappings for each DB15 connector is shown:

### 2. isoSPI communication interface

The isoSPI communication interface is implemented using the [LTC6820](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/LTC6820.pdf)IC. This IC provides a bi-directional interface between standard SPI signals and differential pulses. It also translates the 1.8V SPI signals from the PicoZed to 5V. For termination, a 120 Î© resistor is added. The maximum and minimum operating conditions are provided in the following table:


| Parameter                             |    Conditions     |   MIN   |  MAX  |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------|---------|-------|
| Supply voltage VDD (Differential side)|                   | 2.7 V   | 5.5 V |
| IO supply voltage VDDS (SPI side)     |                   | 1.7 V   | 5.5 V |
| High-level input voltage              |VDDS = 2.7V to 5V  | 0.7 VDDS| VDDS  |
| High-level input voltage              |VDDS = 1.7V to 2.7V| 0.8 VDDS| VDDS  |
| Low-level input voltage               |VDDS = 2.7V to 5V  | 0       | 0.3 VDDS  |
| Low-level input voltage               |VDDS = 1.7V to 2.7V| 0       | 0.2 VDDS  |

This IC can operate at a maximum SPI communication speed of 1 Mbps. Bias resistors (RB1 and RB2) are used to adjust the drive currents to the differential lines, in this design they set the drive currents to 10 mA. The maximum supply current consumed by the IC including to drive currents for differential lines is 15.8 mA, which corresponds to 79 mW for a 5 V supply. More information regarding the operating conditions, bias resistors, maximum throughput rate, can be found in the [datasheet](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/LTC6820.pdf). 


### 3. isoSPI isolation transformer

To add isolation to the differential isoSPI signals, an external isolation barrier is required. This is implemented by adding the HX1188NLT pulse transformer. More information on the pulse transformer is found in the [datasheet](https://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Pulse%20PDFs/10_100BASE-T%20Single%20Port%20SMD%20Magnetics_Rev2008.pdf).


### 4. Single-ended to differential converter

The I/O interface is connected to the FPGA I/O pins of the PicoZed, which can be configured as SPI, UART or any other communication interface. This signal is converted into differential I/O using the AM26C31 differential line driver. The operating conditions for the IC are provided in the following table.

| Parameter                             | MIN   | NOM | MAX   |
|---------------------------------------|-------|-----|-------|
| Supply voltage Vcc                    | 4.5 V | 5 V | 5.5 V |
| Input voltage range                   | -0.5 V|     | Vcc + 0.5 V  |
| High-level input voltage              | 2 V   |     | Vcc   |
| Low-level input voltage               | 0 V   |     | 0.8 V |

The maximum supply current consumed by the IC including the drive currents for the differential lines is around 20 mA, which corresponds to 100 mW for a 5 V supply. For more information refer to the [AM26C31](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/am26c31.pdf?HQS=TI-null-null-digikeymode-df-pf-null-wwe&ts=1590045318995) datasheet.


### 5. Differential to single-ended converter

The differential signal is then converted into a single-ended signal using the AM26C32 differential line receiver. The operating conditions for the IC are provided in the following table.

| Parameter                             | MIN   | NOM | MAX   |
|---------------------------------------|-------|-----|-------|
| Supply voltage Vcc                    | 4.5 V | 5 V | 5.5 V |
| Common-mode input voltage             | -7 V  |     | +7 V  |
| High-level input voltage              | 2 V   |     | Vcc   |
| Low-level input voltage               | 0 V   |     | 0.8 V |

The maximum supply current consumed by the IC including the drive currents for the differential lines is around 10 mA, which corresponds to 50 mW for a 5 V supply. For more information refer to the [AM26C32](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/am26c32.pdf?HQS=TI-null-null-digikeymode-df-pf-null-wwe&ts=1590045351338)datasheet.


### 6. Voltage level shifter

The 5V voltage level from the differential line receiver is translated to 1.8V for the PicoZed using the SN74LVC8T245 level translation IC. This IC supports bi-directional translation, and is also used to translate the low-voltage level (from PicoZed) to 5 V level used by the differential line driver. The voltage levels are translated based on the supply voltage rail A (VCCA) and supply voltage rail B (VCCB). The direction can be set using a direction control pin (DIR), a high on the DIR pin translates the signals from A to B and a low on DIR translates the signals from B to A. The operating voltage range for both A and B ports is from 1.65 V to 5.5 V.  For more information refer the IC [datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74lvc8t245.pdf?HQS=TI-null-null-digikeymode-df-pf-null-wwe&ts=1590052474879).    


## PCB Layout

The DB15 connector and the pulse transformer are located on the top layer. The isoSPI interfacing IC, differential line driver, receiver, and voltage translator ICs are located on the bottom layer. The top layer is used to route the signals from the DB15 connector to the pulse transformer. Inner signal layers 2 and 3 are used to route the signals from the DB15 connector to the differential line driver and receiver ICs. The remaining signals from the ICs to the PicoZed connector are routed using the bottom layer. All the ICs consume less than 100 mA, so the 10 mil thickness trace is used for power supply traces. Most of the signal traces are routed using 6 mil trace thickness.
