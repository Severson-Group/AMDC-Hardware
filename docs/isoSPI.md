# AMDC isoSPI Interface

This document describes the design considerations and implementation details for the isoSPI interface subsystem on the Advanced Motor Drive Controller (AMDC).

## Design Requirements and Considerations

-> what is the main purpose of isoSPI, what problem does it solve.
-> general idea of isoSPI
-> design requirment

## Block Diagram / External Connections

Pictorial representation of isoSPI, with blocks and descriptions of what they do.

## Connector Pinout

Explaination and list of pinout

## Schematics

Discussion related to schematics

## PCB Layout

Discussion related to PCB layout for power subsystem:
- Power distribution trace width
- Signal interface

## Datasheets
